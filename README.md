# Logic and his 2 alter egos - Bobby Tarantino and Young Sinatra 
This project was focused on a musician and their alter egos, specifically Logic and his two alter egos. I used unsupervised machine learning for topic modeling, as well as supervised ML to build a model that predicts which persona a phrase came from.
